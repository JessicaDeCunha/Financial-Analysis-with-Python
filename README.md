# Automate Your Day Job with Python

## PyBank
### Background

In this repo under the PyBank folder I have created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. Using the financial dataset in this file: [budget_data.csv], my objective is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final script will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### Background

These file analyze another business's financial performance by cross-referencing the sales data with the internal menu data to figure out revenues and costs for the year.

For the most recent year I analyze how well the business did on a per-product basis in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly, and, ultimately, which products may need to be removed or changed.
